# Fraud_Classification
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions in financial datasets using machine learning. It implements multiple algorithms, including KNN, RFC, and Decision Trees, and optimizes them through hyperparameter tuning. The model evaluates accuracy, precision, and recall for effective fraud detection.
